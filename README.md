## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use CSS custom properties to manage colors and typography effectively. I also practiced creating a responsive layout using Flexbox. Here's an example of a CSS snippet I'm proud of:

```css
.qr-container {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    padding: 16px 16px 40px;
    gap: 24px;
    box-shadow: 0px 25px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0476518);
    border-radius: 20px;
    background-color: var(--white);
    max-width: 320px;
    width: auto;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus on improving my accessibility skills and ensuring my designs meet WCAG standards. I also plan to explore CSS Grid for more complex layouts.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) - This helped me understand how to use Flexbox for layout.
- [Frontend Mentor Community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/community) - The community provided inspiration and guidance for this project.
